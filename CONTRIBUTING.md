How To Contribute
So, you’ve developed something interesting or fixed a defect and want to have it added to our official release? Lets learn about the contribution process so we can get your code baked into the next release.

About Rights
The Mishusoft project is licensed as Apache v2.0 License. If you provide any code to us and your code is added to the project, the code you provide will automatically inherit the same Apache License, Version 2.0.

Your contribution will be subject to license Clause #5.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

Getting Started
Make sure you have a GitHub account
IMPORTANT - Start a thread in the Mishusoft Community Forums related to your issue
Start the conversation regarding this defect or feature
Please provide a simplified code sample demonstrating how to reproduce the feature or issue
Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce when it is a bug
Fork the repository on GitHub
Forking
You can fork our project from GitHub, develop/merge your feature or bugfix, then submit a Pull Request. Please keep in mind that:

Pull requests are actual commits with your modified code
One pull request must contain all commits related to that feature or bug fix (full changeset)
Each commit is hopefully a happy-commit
The pull request should be closest to the latest target branch (a pull request of a feature from version 1.0 would most likely be unusable for a feature on version 3.0, although you might be able to use git rebase to fix that
Submitting Changes
Push your changes to a branch in your fork of the repository
Submit a pull request to the related Mishusoft project
Check the Status of the Pull Request for acceptance of the Contributor License Agreement
Update your forum thread with a link to your Pull Request
Your Pull Request will be reviewed by the Object.NET team. We will analyze your change and if it fits the coding standards and feature demand, we’ll add it to the main project.

My Feature Is Awesomesauce!
Why don't you add it now?

Some features or fixes might be brilliant additions, but break backwards compatibility. We may consider a change ineligible for immediate merging if it turns Mishusoft too far away from our current release plan.

Not to worry, we will try our best to add your contribution into our next release!

Bug Or Feature?
If we still have a bug lurking around we will do our best to fix it promptly.

Bug fixes are much more likely to be accepted in a short term than entirely new features that might compromise other parts of Mishusoft or developer experience.

We've also created an up-for-grabs Label in the Issues. In general all the Issues could be considered up-for-grabs, but we labeled a few issues to help highlight a possible easy entry point into contributing to the Mishusoft project.

Will I Get Paid For Bugs Or Features?
Your reward is the sweet karma in knowing you’ve helped the community.

If you turn out to be a bug squashing and feature adding wizard... we would like to get to know you better. There’s always an open seat at Object.NET for a talented engineer.

We are a fully distributed company with team members spread across Earth. All positions are Remote.
