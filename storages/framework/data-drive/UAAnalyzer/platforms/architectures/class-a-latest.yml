# Intel's consumer-grade processors have followed an *86 naming convention,
# dating back to the 8086 chip released in 1978. Later iterations included the 16-bit i286 in 1983,
# the 32-bit i386 in 1985, the 32-bit i486 in 1989, the i586 (the original Pentium chip) in 1993,
# the i686 (the Pentium Pro) in 1995, and the i786 (Pentium 4, or NetBurst) in 2000.
