Use cases
All versions of Internet Explorer for Windows from 4.0 onwards use Trident, and it is also used by various other web browsers and software components (see Internet Explorer shells). In Windows 98, Windows Me, and Windows 2000, it is also used for the Windows file manager/shell, Windows Explorer.[19] The Add/Remove Programs tool in Windows 2000 uses Trident to render the list of installed programs,[20] and in Windows XP it is also used for the User Accounts Control Panel, which is an HTML Application.[21] Trident, however, was not used by Internet Explorer for Mac (which used Tasman starting with version 5.0), nor by the early versions of Internet Explorer Mobile.
