# ARM (stylised in lowercase as arm, previously an acronym for Advanced RISC Machines and originally Acorn RISC Machine)
# is a family of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architectures for computer processors, configured for various environments.
# Arm Ltd. develops the architecture and licenses it to other companies, who design their own products that implement
# one of those architectures‍—‌including systems-on-chips (SoC) and systems-on-modules (SoM) that incorporate different components such as memory,
# interfaces, and radios.
